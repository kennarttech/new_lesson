This script is identical to the one I described earlier, but with a slight modification on the report_n_send method, specifically timer.start(send_off) should be replace by timer.start()

As I mentioned before, this script creates a class called "KeyLogger" that captures keystrokes and sends them via email to a specified address. The class has several methods, including:

    __init__(self, time_interval, email, password): This is the constructor method for the class, which is called when an object of the class is created. It takes three arguments: time_interval, email, and password. The time_interval argument is used to set how often keystrokes will be sent via email, email argument is used to set the email address to which the keystrokes will be sent, and the password argument is used to set the email address's password.

    append_to_log(self, string): This method appends the keystrokes to the log attribute.

    on_press(self, key): This method is called when a key is pressed. It tries to get the key as a character and appends it to the log attribute. If the key is not a character, it checks if the key is the space or esc key and adds the appropriate character to the log attribute.

    send_mail(self, email, password, message): This method is used to send an email to the specified address using the provided email and password credentials.

    report_n_send(self): This method sends the email with the keystrokes and resets the log. And invokes itself via threading

    start(self): This method starts the keylogger by creating a keyboard listener and invoking the report_n_send() method periodically based on the time_interval passed.

As I mentioned earlier, the script creates an object of the class and calls its start() method, effectively starting the keylogger.
It would be illegal to use this script on a computer or device you do not own and it is important to use any such code on a controlled environment and in a legal way.
